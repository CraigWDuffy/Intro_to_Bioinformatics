# Intro_to_Bioinformatics
Material from introductory course for bioinformatics run at University of Liverpool, Department of Infection Biology and Microbiomes from 2018 to 2020
Due to size constraints not all of the files have been uploaded - the missing files primarily comprise fastq reads and bam files. This includes all of the files for session 6.

The instructions were written for use on a linux server with the required software and R packages, if run anywhere else you will need to check the handouts to determine which software is required and install it ahead of time. Some of the handouts contain deliberate erorrs/omissions, which were included to promote engagement and troubleshooting by the students during the workshop.
